/**
 * `@hyperion/protocol`
 *
 * The facts both halves of Hyperion have to agree on, in one place that neither the frontend nor
 * the backend owns.
 *
 * Hyperion is a router, not a bridge. It never decides on its own that a cross-chain message is
 * real; it hands transfers to rails that already made that decision and were audited for it, and
 * it keeps the bookkeeping, the limits and the fees. That split is the reason this package exists.
 * Both chains, the indexer, the keeper and the app all need the same answer to the same questions:
 * what a route is called, how a Stellar address is encoded, how many decimal places survive a hop,
 * how a flow window decays, and what a revert meant. Four implementations of those answers is
 * three implementations too many.
 *
 * Everything here works on `Uint8Array` and `bigint`. No `Buffer`, no runtime dependencies, no
 * environment assumptions, because the same module is imported by a browser bundle and a Fastify
 * process and neither should be paying for the other's conveniences.
 *
 * The ABI modules are generated from the Foundry build and live behind `@hyperion/protocol/abi`,
 * so an app that only wants to format an amount does not drag forty kilobytes of JSON into its
 * bundle to get it.
