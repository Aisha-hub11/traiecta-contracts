/**
 * What Hyperion says to itself across a rail.
 *
 * Every rail delivers to a contract, not to a person. The address on the envelope is Hyperion's own
 * contract on the far side, so who the money is actually for has to be written inside. These are
 * those notes, in the same packed layout `HyperionNotes.sol` writes and `hyperion_core::axelar`
 * reads.
 *
 * Two shapes, one per direction, because the directions describe different things. Coming out of
 * Stellar a note names an EVM address, which is twenty flat bytes. Going into Stellar it names a
 * strkey rather than a raw key, because the checksum comes free with the format and catches a
 * flipped bit before anybody gets paid.
 *
 * Both carry the originating router's nonce. No contract needs it. The person watching a transfer
 * does, because it is the one value that appears on both sides of a hop, which is what lets the app
 * say "this delivery is that transfer" instead of guessing from amounts and timestamps.
