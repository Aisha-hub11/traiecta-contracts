/**
 * Pricing a route without asking the chain.
 *
 * The router has a `quote` that never reverts, which is the honest answer and the one an app
 * should show before anybody signs. This is the same ladder, in the same order, running locally.
 * It exists for one reason: a planner that has to render four rails while somebody is still
 * typing cannot do four `eth_call`s per keystroke, and a number that appears half a second after
 * the digit that produced it feels broken even when it is right.
 *
 * So the app prices locally as you type and confirms on chain before you sign. The two have to
 * agree, and `quote.test.ts` walks the same cases through both. Where they ever disagree the
 * chain is right and this file is a bug.
