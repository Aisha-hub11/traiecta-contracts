/**
 * The assets Hyperion carries, per chain.
 *
 * The same dollar has a different address, a different precision and a different way of being held
 * on every chain it exists on, and a bridge that treats those as interchangeable is a bridge that
 * eventually sends six decimals of something into a seven decimal slot. So each side is described
 * on its own terms and the two are tied together by a symbol rather than by an assumption.
 *
 * Provenance works the same way it does for the rail contracts: `confirmed` means a primary source
 * was read for that exact entry during this build. The deploy script reads `symbol()` and
 * `decimals()` on chain before registering anything regardless, because an address that is correct
 * today and a token that behaves as expected are two different claims.
