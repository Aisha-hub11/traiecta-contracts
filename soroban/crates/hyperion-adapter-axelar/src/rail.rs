//! Axelar's Interchain Token Service, as this adapter calls it.
//!
//! Declared here rather than pulled in as a dependency, for the same reason Circle's contracts
//! are. Axelar's Stellar packages are not on crates.io, and vendoring a git revision of somebody
//! else's workspace into a contract build is a supply chain decision rather than a convenience.
//! Soroban resolves a cross contract call by function name and argument shape at invocation time,
//! so a transcription that has drifted fails immediately and loudly on the first call rather than
//! quietly doing the wrong thing.
//!
//! Transcribed from `axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier-stellar` on branch `main`:
//!
//! - `contracts/stellar-interchain-token-service/src/interface.rs`
//! - `contracts/stellar-interchain-token-service/src/types.rs`
//! - `packages/stellar-axelar-std/src/types.rs`
