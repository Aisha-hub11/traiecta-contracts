//! What this adapter announces.
//!
//! Four topics is the ceiling, and the pair at the front of each one spends two of them on
//! `hyperion` and on the rail plus direction. That leaves two for the fields a subscriber
//! actually filters on, which here means the asset and the far side's chain. Everything else
//! lives in the body, where it costs nothing to carry and is still part of the contract spec,
//! so an indexer reads these as real types rather than as loose maps.
//!
//! Every configuration change shares one topic pair on purpose. The monitoring job that cares
//! about them cares about all of them at once, and wants a single subscription that fires
//! whenever somebody rewires a lane.
