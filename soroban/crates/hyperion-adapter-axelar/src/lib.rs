//! Hyperion's adapter for Axelar, covering both shapes Stellar's Interchain Token Service
//! offers.
//!
//! Axelar is the general purpose rail. A validator set watches the source chain, signs off on
//! what it saw, and a gateway on the destination chain replays it. The Interchain Token Service
//! sits on top of that and knows about tokens: a token id has a manager on each chain, and a
//! transfer either burns and mints or locks and unlocks depending on how that manager was set
//! up. None of that is Hyperion's to verify. This adapter is the two thin edges.
//!
//! # One WASM, two shapes
//!
//! An instance is wired at `initialize` for exactly one route and never changes its mind.
//!
//! `AxelarIts` is the bare shape. A transfer goes out naming the recipient on the far side
//! directly, and Axelar delivers it there with nothing else attached. Nothing comes back the
//! other way, because a bare transfer arriving on Stellar is delivered by ITS straight to the
//! address it names and Hyperion is never in the path at all. The router's inbound receiver for
//! this route stays unset, so `bridge_in` fails closed on it.
//!
//! `AxelarGmp` is the shape that carries a note. Outbound, the transfer is addressed to
//! Hyperion's own contract on the far side and the real recipient travels in the payload.
//! Inbound, ITS calls `execute_with_interchain_token` here and this contract hands the funds to
//! the router.
//!
//! That second shape is worth its extra moving parts for one reason. A bare ITS transfer to a
//! Stellar account with no trustline for the asset reverts the whole Axelar execution and
//! strands the message; there is no partial success and no retry that will ever work. Routing
//! through Hyperion instead lets the router park the delivery as a claim that the recipient can
//! settle themselves once they have opened the trustline. The same argument covers muxed
//! accounts, which the bare shape has nowhere to put and this one carries fine.
//!
//! # Why no gas token
//!
//! Axelar's relayers want paying, and ITS takes a `gas_token` for that. Hyperion always passes
//! `None`.
//!
//! The gas service charges its `spender`, and it does so one frame below ITS. Naming this
//! adapter as the spender would therefore need an invoker authorisation covering a call this
//! contract does not make, against a payload ITS computes internally from Axelar's own message
//! schema. Reproducing that encoding here would mean carrying a copy of somebody else's wire
//! format that breaks silently rather than loudly, and paying the gas service directly
//! beforehand does not help either: the gateway credits a payment against the hash of the
//! message it actually emitted, which does not exist yet.
//!
//! Axelar's answer to exactly this is `add_gas`, which tops up a message that has already been
//! emitted. So Hyperion's keeper watches for the gateway event and pays on it from off chain,
//! out of its own balance, against the real message id. One fewer authorisation for this
//! contract to hold, and one less transcription of Axelar's internals to keep in step.
//!
//! # What this contract does not do
//!
//! It does not verify anything Axelar signed. It never sees a signature. On the way in it is
//! called by ITS and its entire claim to trust is that ITS is the direct invoker, which the
//! host proves rather than this code.
