//! Hyperion's adapter for Circle's Cross Chain Transfer Protocol, version 2.
//!
//! CCTP is the canonical rail for USDC. A transfer burns on the source chain, Circle's attestation
//! service signs a message saying so, and the destination chain mints the same amount against that
//! signature. There is no pool, no wrapped asset and no liquidity provider, which is why Hyperion
//! treats it as the default route whenever both ends support it.
//!
//! This adapter is the two thin edges of that. On the way out it approves the messenger and calls
//! `deposit_for_burn`, and on the way in it is the mint recipient: a relayer hands it a message and
//! an attestation, it works out where the funds are meant to end up, lets Circle's own transmitter
//! do the verifying and minting, and passes the result to the router.
//!
//! # Why the adapter is the mint recipient
//!
//! A CCTP mint recipient is a single thirty two byte word. That is enough for a Stellar contract
//! id or an account id, but not enough to say which of the two it is, and not enough at all for a
//! muxed account, which needs another eight bytes for the subaccount. Naming a user's account
//! directly as the mint recipient would therefore work for the easy case and quietly lose
//! information in the interesting ones.
//!
//! So the mint recipient is always this contract, and the real destination travels in the hook
//! data, which CCTP v2 lets you make as long as you like. This contract resolves the destination
//! from the hook **before** it asks the transmitter to mint anything, so a destination this route
//! cannot honour is a refusal on an unchanged ledger rather than a pile of freshly minted tokens
//! with nowhere to go.
//!
//! # What this contract does not do
//!
//! It does not check attestations. It does not know what one looks like. Every signature check
//! happens inside `message-transmitter-v2`, which is Circle's contract, audited by Circle's
//! auditors, and Hyperion's security depends on that being true rather than on anything written
//! here.
