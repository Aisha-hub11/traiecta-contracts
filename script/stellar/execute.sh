# Phase two on Stellar: execute what phase one queued, once the timelock has matured.
#
# Walks the queued actions in the order they were queued and stops at the first one that is not
# ready rather than skipping it, because these actions depend on each other. Enabling a route before
# its adapter is set leaves a rail that is on and unreachable.
#
# Safe to run more than once. An action already executed is reported and skipped, so a run
# interrupted by a failed transaction picks up where it left off rather than requiring somebody to
# work out by hand which of eight actions landed.

# Usage: script/stellar/execute.sh
