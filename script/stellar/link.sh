# Point a deployed Stellar adapter at its counterpart on the other chain.
#
# A separate step from the deployment, and not for tidiness. An adapter's peer cannot be named
# before the peer exists, and `link_domain`, `map_asset`, `link_chain` and `map_token` are all once
# only on purpose: repointing a live lane would let a different contract deliver on a chain people
# are already using, which is a new trust assumption rather than a configuration change. So a
# guessed peer address is a mistake no later transaction can undo, and the only safe order is to
# deploy both sides first and link second.
#
# Run this after the far side exists and you have its addresses in front of you.
#
# Usage:
#   HYPERION_PEER_CHAIN=arc-testnet \
#   AXELAR_PEER_CHAIN=arc-8 \
#   AXELAR_PEER_ADDRESS=0x... \
#   AXELAR_TOKEN_ID=0x... \
